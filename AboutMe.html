<p>I dont like to be alone in the night because i am feared and 
    i will get bad dreams like something is gone come for me but 
    i am never alone ifeel like that. </p>
<h1> My favourite movie is Akhanda </h1>
<p>JaiBalayaa! JaiJaiBalayya 
    Nandamuri BalaKrishna a great actor who has the dual role in this film and the second role of the aghora
     played by him is in the next level performance and the last fight is like lord shiva came into the fight by himself.
     Thats why JaiBalayya! JaiJaiBalayya
